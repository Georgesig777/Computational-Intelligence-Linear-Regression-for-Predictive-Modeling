# Computational Intelligence – Linear Regression for Predictive Modelling

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building linear regression models to predict system behavior based on given input data. It was developed as part of the "Computational Intelligence" course and includes two main exercises:

1. **Single-variable Linear Regression:** Given a dataset with values following the equation `y = ax + b`, we use the Least Squares Method to estimate the coefficients `a` and `b`. We also compute quality metrics to assess the accuracy of the model.
2. **Multivariable Linear Regression:** Extending the first exercise, this part involves multiple input variables, making the model more complex. The challenge is to estimate multiple weight coefficients (`a1, a2, ..., an`) for a multidimensional linear model.

The project also includes graphical comparisons between real and predicted values, along with error analysis.
